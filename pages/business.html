                <p>Fitelty comes from two words - Fit and Healthy. It also rhymes with "Fidelity". A service that takes into account your blood pressure, heart rate, age, weight, etc. And infers the health condition of the user. It will recommend you a personalised diet, sleep and exercise schedule, providing you with methods and correct steps to proceed to a healthier lifestyle, while ensuring the user's "fidelity" and interest. Many other health related features are included.
                    <br><br>
                    We target smart watch manafacturing companies, offering them to include our service in their watch and to be sold to all kinds of customers - Athletes or Fitness Enthusiasts, And people who want to change their lifestyle and become more healthy and fit. The heart rate and blood pressure will be monitored through sensors in the watches.
                    <br><br>
                    The smart watch market is huge in India and is growing. There are all kinds of customers - those who want it specifically for fitness, and those who want it just as a smart watch. We target both kinds of people but support a common aim for them. To slowly change their lifestyle while being guided with the right steps to lead a healthier life. There are a lot of companies entering the market, yet there exists a gap that our business can fulfill. Instead of giving users raw values of heart rate and steps walked, which isn't quite useful to the average person, we rather give convert it into more understandable and relevant information like - what does it mean for their health? How can they make it better? What all should be done to achieve that?
                    <br><br>
                    The schedules start out simple, to help get the user started. But are dynamic and keeps adjusting and evolving as the user progresses and notices difference in their lifestyle. Yet, we provide flexibility for power users who can accordingly set their preferred amount and intensity of training.
                    <b></b> 
                    We want our services to be installed in multiple smart watch selling companies and also on other systems, devices and technological ecosystems. With our features, we have an edge over competitors (other smart watch companies). The pricing of the overall watch will be closed to a budget-friendly smart watch while also ensuring the quality of the product.
                    <br><br>
                    We plan to offer watches with Fitelty for a price of around ₹7000, chosen in order to make the service available to the maximum number of people, while ensuring the quality of the product and having enough for research and experimentation to increase accuracy. Compared to the prices of the competitors, this price is advantageous. We plan to use Online Digital Marketting, as it will reach out to the maximum potential customers considering lockdown. It will also help them realise not to spend to much time in front of screens and start exercising. And to break that sudden change in lifestyle, Fitelty will guide with small, simple and easy steps to get the user on track.
                    <br><br>
                    For our management team, we need a group of knowledgable health scientists to provide data, research and experiment on sleep patterns, diets, and exercises for the human body based on particular health conditions. We also need a group of software engineers with knowledge & experience in Machine Learning, in order to automatically formulate the best diet, sleep schedule and exercise schedule. Our suppliers will be smart watch manafacturing companies, on the devices of which, Fitelty will be installed and experimented upon. We aim to span over multiple watch companies and other technologies as well.

                <p>The market for smart watches today is huge and is expanding. All sorts of people - those who buy it for fitness and those who buy it for the other "smart" features and as an accessory. Many tech companies are entering the market, yet, there is a gap that our business can fulfil. General smart watches/fitness bands may provide heart rate monitoring and steps counting. But those values aren't directly helpful to the average user.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Fitelty solves the problem. Why measure heart rate and blood pressure? It's to get an insight on the user's health conditions. How do we use it? One must ensure good nutrition and avoiding the food that is harmful for their condition. The amount and intensity of exercise one should do depends on the diet as well. It will be easy for those who want get started, they will be guided with the right and simple exercises. The level and amount will increase with their progress and time. It is also essential to maintain the right amount of sleep.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The target clients will be smart watch making companies. Our service will be installed in their watches and be sold to people. Our competitors will be other smart watch manafacturing companies like Amazfit, Apple, Fire-Boltt, Fitbit, Huawei, MI, Noise, Samsung, etc. Most of them are equally positioned on the smart watch market and offer similar features. The price of a decent budget smart watch is ₹3000-₹6000 and do not offer the features we do. We have a competitive edge over them as our service satisfies the true purpose of a smart watch made for fitness i.e. guiding the users on how to become fit and healthier.</p>
